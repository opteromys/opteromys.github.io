## First flight of Condor!

The lockdown is finally over, there is so much to test out with our new **Condor** prototype!

Condor weighs 7kg without payload (accepting up to 8kg thereof). Even without a payload, the paramotor remains within the wing's mass range which is exactly the kind of flexibility we were aiming for with this new design.

Our first flight with Condor is a success! Usually, when you design a drone, you expect all kinds of problems to occur during the first experiments (a component failure, an unexpected reboot of your controller or on-board computer... the possibilities are endless). What a bliss to have none of these issues and simply appreciate a smooth flight!

This first flights tells us a lot about this prototype's dynamics though. Yes, it flew, but we could notice major discrepancies with our lightweight Goose prototype. Condor tends to sway for a little while after a sharp turn, and takes a long time to recover. Although this lateral mode was expected, its actual amplitude proved to be higher than we thought. We also have a slower response time when activating one of the brakes. Studying this mode carefully and finding ways to damp it (hardware-wise or control-wise) would be beneficial.

(Do not reproduce this at home) To catch a 7kg drone flying steadily towards you, you better be in good shape! :wink:
